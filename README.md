# Keras-Tutorial
 
Main focus of this tutorial is to understand implementation of keras for different types of problems. 
### This repository includes the basic tutorial on Keras including basic construct using Input, Dropout, compiling, training and saving the model, weights in YAML file. 
### And also Keras implementation for the regression problem.



#Note : Code is not optimized for best run-time or best accuracy. It is purely to understand the key contructs in solving problem using keras.
